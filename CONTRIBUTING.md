## Reporting Bugs

Please file bugs in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/umilab/wesync/issues). Include at
least the following:

 - What happened

 - What did you expect to happen instead of what *did* happen, if it's
   not crazy obvious

 - What operating system, operating system version and version of
   Syncthing you are running

 - The same for other connected devices, where relevant

 - Screenshot if the issue concerns something visible in the GUI

 - Console log entries, where possible and relevant

If you're not sure whether something is relevant, erring on the side of
too much information will never get you yelled at. :)
